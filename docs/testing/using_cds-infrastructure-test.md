### Using the CDS Infrastructure Test Module

# Why is there a submodule here?

This is a nice present set aside for future programmers (sort of). We want to make sure our code functions the way it should, so we're going to set up this 'fake' submodule here to act as a test environment for our scripts. 

# How do I use this?

TBD - depends on scripts. We'll want some way to route them based on test vs. execution mode. Look forward to hearing more from us!
